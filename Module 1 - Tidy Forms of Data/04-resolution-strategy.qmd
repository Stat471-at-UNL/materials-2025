# There are inconsistencies - now what?


# Immediate Actions

- **Document!**: Record the inconsistency type, location, scope, and examples
- **Assess impact**: Determine how it affects existing downstream processes and analyses 
- **Quarantine affected data**: don't let problematic records go any further

# Resolution Strategy

- **Investigate root cause**: Trace back to source systems or processes - where does the problem come from?
- **Consult domain experts**: Is it a known problem? 
- **Choose correction method**: and document it!

# Correction Framework
- **High confidence fixes**: Automate corrections (e.g., standardize formats)
- **Medium confidence**: Flag for review with suggested corrections (warning in code)
- **Low confidence**: Escalate to subject matter experts (strong warning in code)
- **Cannot resolve**: Document limitations and exclude from analysis (error message in code)

# Implementation

- **Create correction rules** that can be reapplied
- **Validate fixes** so you do not accidentally introduce new problems
- **Update documentation** and data lineage
- **Communicate changes** to stakeholders
- **Monitor** for recurring issues

# Some Examples

**Inconsistency Found:** Customer names in different formats
```
"John Smith", "JOHN SMITH", "Smith, John", "J. Smith"
```

**Actions Taken:**

- **Document:** "Name standardization needed - 4 different formats for same customer"
- **Solution:** Create standardization rules (e.g. Title Case, "First Last" format) and apply
- **Result:** All become "John Smith"
- **Prevention:** add a customer ID to make sure that J. Smith isn't confused with Jayden Smith.

# Date Format Example

**Inconsistency Found:** Mixed date formats
```
"01/02/2023", "2023-01-02", "Feb 1, 2023", "1-2-23"
```

**Actions Taken:**

- **High confidence:** Convert obvious ISO dates automatically
- **Medium confidence:** Flag ambiguous dates (01/02 - Jan 2 or Feb 1?)
- **Solution:** Standardize to ISO format, manually review ambiguous cases


# Address Example

**Inconsistency Found:** Incomplete addresses
```
"123 Main", "123 Main St", "123 Main Street, Anytown"
```

**Actions Taken:**

- **Standardize:** Use postal service abbreviations ("St")
- **Geocode validation:** Verify addresses exist
- **Flag incomplete:** Missing city/state for manual review
