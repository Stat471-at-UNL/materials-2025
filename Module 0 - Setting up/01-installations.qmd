# Work environment in this class

- R in the RStudio IDE

- Github repositories for 

  - homework assignments
  - final project


# How current is your environment?

Jenny Bryan, Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, chapter 5.1:  

> Get current, people. 

Good practice: 

  - R: don't fall behind more than one minor version (update once a year)
  - RStudio: new features are constantly released. (Jenny: once a month, Heike: whenever I think of it - maybe twice a year??)
  - git: update with operating system
  
# Homework for next Tuesday: check your installations and update if needed
